# yo victor i put some specs below and a basic function
# skeleton, html will be a string holding all the HTML
# and components will be the return array, let me know
# if you have any questions

def parseHTML(html)
	# components will have an array of objects that each
	# preferably hold at least the following attributes:
	# 1. component type (i.e image, video, URL link)
	# 2. content (i.e image link, video link, URL)
	# 3. if possible, can you try to include a hash
	# that contains all other HTML tags in the element?
	# something like {"class" => "body", "media" => "handheld"}
	components = []

	# parse html here, nokogiri is probably a reasonable
	# option to try first

	return components
